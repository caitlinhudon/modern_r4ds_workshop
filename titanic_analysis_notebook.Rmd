# Data Gathering
1. Where is my data?
2. What do the different things mean?

# Data Exploration
1. What does my data look like?
2. Are there columns that are bad candidates for inclusion in models?
3. Do I need to do any handling of missing values or outliers?

# Sampling
1. How do I sample to arrive at a robust model?
2. Do I need to do any additional sampling strategies?

# Feature Engineering
1. How should I process the data so that it meets the expectations of the models I want to use it for?
2. Do I need multiple recipes to support multiple types?
3. What steps do I need to take? What do my numerical variables look like for instance?



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
